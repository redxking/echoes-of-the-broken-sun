# Echoes of the Broken Sun

**Author and creator:** Angelis Pseftis  
**Current state:** This is a verified Unreal technical prototype, not a completed game. UE 5.8.2 is installed; the native simulation passes 10/10 hardened suites in optimized, debug, and sanitizer configurations; the arm64 Development Editor target builds; Unreal automation passes 2/2, including a real visible-hidden-visible actor lifecycle; null-RHI bootstrap reaches the first fixed tick; rendered startup and one Future Well keyboard command have been observed; and a self-contained arm64 Mac Development package has passed structural, signature-seal, and headless startup checks. Full pointer interaction, gameplay-loop completeness, performance, clean-machine use, Developer ID signing, notarization, and release qualification remain open.

*Echoes of the Broken Sun* is an original science-fantasy real-time strategy game for macOS. Its central strategic resource, the Future Well, forces a player to choose between immediate power, sustained possibility, and temporary transformation of the battlefield.

The repository is intentionally evidence-bounded. A file or menu stub is not treated as a working feature. The current implementation includes an Unreal Engine 5.8 project, Apple Silicon configuration, source-controlled balance definitions, a tool-independent deterministic C++ simulation, and a runtime Unreal adapter with a generated arena, visibility-scoped placeholder entity views, RTS camera, selection/controller layer, HUD, opponent AI, and Future Well orders. The rendered scene has been inspected and is explicitly labeled `RUNTIME TECHNICAL PROTOTYPE`; the engine primitives remain placeholders rather than final art. Test results and remaining limitations are recorded in [Docs/ProjectLedger.md](Docs/ProjectLedger.md).

## Current development gate

Unreal Engine 5.8.2 is installed at `/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.8` and its completed launcher manifest has been inspected. The separately delivered Apple Metal Toolchain is installed. The host is a 16 GB M1 Pro Mac with about 71 GiB free after the final package, test evidence, and redundant-build cleanup. That is above the project's 40 GiB prototype-build stop threshold and its preferred 60 GiB packaging headroom, but below the safer 100 GiB sustained-production target. A verified official launcher-installer backup exists at `~/Downloads/EpicInstaller-20.1.4.dmg`, but it should not replace the newer installed launcher.

The current Unreal integration gate is:

1. Stop prototype builds below 40 GiB free, restore at least 60 GiB before large imports or release packaging, and target 100 GiB for sustained production. These are project engineering thresholds, not Epic-published minimums.
2. Keep full Xcode selected. Xcode 26.6 has passed project generation, arm64 editor compilation, two Unreal automation tests, null-RHI and rendered startup, and local Development cooking/packaging; Epic still recommends 26.1.1, and clean-machine use plus representative performance workloads remain unverified.
3. Complete pointer-driven interaction checks, implement the missing gameplay loop and true fog/shroud presentation, and profile the target scene before content expansion.
4. Follow [Docs/SetupAndBuild.md](Docs/SetupAndBuild.md) and record every accepted result in the ledger.

## Repository map

- `Source/EchoesSimCore`: deterministic, engine-independent RTS simulation
- `Source/EchoesOfTheBrokenSun`: Unreal presentation and interaction module
- `Content/Data/Source`: authoritative source data for factions, units, structures, and Future Wells
- `Config`: macOS/Apple Silicon Unreal defaults
- `Tests/Native`: simulation tests runnable before Unreal is installed
- `Docs/DevelopmentBible.md`: game, universe, campaign, UI, audio, accessibility, and player-experience design
- `Docs/TechnicalArchitecture.md`: simulation, Unreal integration, AI, networking, save, replay, and build architecture
- `Docs/ProjectLedger.md`: decisions, roadmap, acceptance evidence, risks, performance budgets, and known limitations
- `Docs/AssetRegister.md`: asset provenance and distribution status

All project documents are authoritative files edited in place. No document is a claim of production readiness.
