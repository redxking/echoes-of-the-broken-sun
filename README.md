# Echoes of the Broken Sun

**Author and creator:** Angelis Pseftis  
**Current state:** This is a verified Unreal playable-systems prototype moving into its Glass Scar vertical slice, not a completed game. Version 0.33.0 retains distinct deterministic identities and production for all sixteen named Meridian Compact and Kharuun Assemblies slice archetypes and adds the first faction mechanic: a Meridian Bulwark can deploy cardinal-facing public cover, reduce frontal damage within an authored protected footprint, move at an authored reduced rate while deployed, and pack up through the same command. The canonical content SHA-256 is `a5ac74b23b572f2db4baf1236738a7f09b682d0de91580336af1f5a57dbb5586`; rules, schema-12 snapshots/replays, player views, AI observations, and checksums carry the deployment parameters and public state. The deterministic core passes 20/20 suites in optimized, debug, and sanitizer configurations; the arm64 Development Editor builds; Unreal automation passes 14/14 without warnings or errors; and normal plus 400-unit/four-team runtime gates remain green. The `Backslash` command faces undeployed selected Bulwarks toward the cursor or packs deployed Bulwarks, and the world proxy exposes a directional barrier. Flanking bypasses the protection. Relay supply extension, Waystone migration, warform adaptation, Cairnback temporary cover, Resonant/Listening Spine detection, and broader faction systems remain unimplemented. Campaign, multiplayer, and replay UI remain hidden. The latest accepted package remains clean-source 0.23.1 at commit `98a9b83`; version 0.33.0 has not been packaged or profiled because storage remains at the packaging floor without safe transient margin. Final effects, formations, complete pointer interaction, a rendered end-to-end player-driven match, networked multiplayer, clean-machine use, Developer ID signing, notarization, final art/audio, complete accessibility/settings implementation, and release qualification remain open.

*Echoes of the Broken Sun* is an original science-fantasy real-time strategy game for macOS. Its central strategic resource, the Future Well, forces a player to choose between immediate power, sustained possibility, and temporary transformation of the battlefield.

The repository is intentionally evidence-bounded. A file or menu stub is not treated as a working feature. The current implementation includes an Unreal Engine 5.8 project, Apple Silicon configuration, source-controlled balance definitions, a tool-independent deterministic C++ simulation, and a runtime Unreal adapter with a generated arena, visibility-scoped placeholder entity views, RTS camera, selection/controller layer, HUD, opponent AI, construction, one-slot unit production, logistics capacity, pause/restart, Command-Core victory state, and Future Well orders. The rendered scene is explicitly labeled as an active-development playable-systems build; the engine primitives remain placeholders rather than final art. Test results and remaining limitations are recorded in [Docs/ProjectLedger.md](Docs/ProjectLedger.md).

## Current development gate

Unreal Engine 5.8.2 is installed at `/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.8` and its completed launcher manifest has been inspected. The separately delivered Apple Metal Toolchain is installed. The host is a 16 GB M1 Pro Mac with about 60.1 GiB free at the 0.31.0 source-evidence checkpoint. That is effectively the project's 60 GiB packaging floor and provides no safe transient margin; the safer sustained-production target is 100 GiB. Rebuildable staging trees and superseded packages remain recoverable in Trash and still occupy space until Trash is emptied. New packaging remains deferred until meaningful headroom is reclaimed. A verified official launcher-installer backup exists at `~/Downloads/EpicInstaller-20.1.4.dmg`, but it should not replace the newer installed launcher.

The current Unreal integration gate is:

1. Stop prototype builds below 40 GiB free, restore at least 60 GiB before large imports or release packaging, and target 100 GiB for sustained production. These are project engineering thresholds, not Epic-published minimums.
2. Keep full Xcode selected. Xcode 26.6 has passed project generation, arm64 editor compilation, fourteen Unreal automation tests, null-RHI startup for both normal and 400-unit/four-team fixtures, and local Development cooking/packaging; Epic still recommends 26.1.1, and clean-machine use remains unverified.
3. Complete pointer-driven selection, placement, production, movement, combat, victory, and restart validation as one rendered match. Then replace technical primitives and procedural atmosphere with an authored vertical-slice roster, effects, terrain, interface, and audio under the performance and provenance gates.
4. Follow [Docs/SetupAndBuild.md](Docs/SetupAndBuild.md) and record every accepted result in the ledger.
